RobotTurtlesReborn

This school project aims at virtualising the board game Robot Turtles, which aims at teaching the basis of programming to childrens.
The objective is to reach a jewel before the other players.
To move his turtle on the board, a player must put cards representing one action (move forward, turn on the left/right, shoot a laser) in a program and execute it.
However, a player can't look at what is in his program so he must remember of his actions.

The rules used are the "Galapagos" rules.
At the beginning of each turn, a player has 5 cards in his hand.
Each turn, a player can choose between 3 actions :
    - putting some cards in his program (he can do it as much as he want as long as he still has cards obviously)
    - executing his program
    - putting a wall somewhere on the board (he can do it as long as he still has at least one wall of the type he wants to build)
If a player just wants to pass, it is possible.
At the end of his turn, a player can discard as much cards as he want. Then he draw enough cards from his deck to have a full hand (5 cards) again.

Walls :
At the beginning of the game, a player has 3 stone walls and 2 ice walls.
Ice walls are breakable (players can destroy them with lasers) whereas stone walls aren't.
A player must never be completely held up from reaching a jewel. Consequently there must always remain a path between each player and a jewel. If players can be moved back to their starting point, there must remain a path between each player's original position and a jewel.
If a player tries to completely block a player - or a starting point if need be - then he is forbidden to do so and must choose another action to do or pass.
